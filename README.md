I'm thrilled to share NZWalks, a complete ASP.NET Core Web API built with .NET 8, simulating a real-world backend system for managing walking tracks and regions in New Zealand. The project includes secure user authentication, role-based access, and a solid architectural foundation — all from scratch.

🧠 Project Highlights:
✅ C# / ASP.NET Core Web API 
🏛️ Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
⚙️ CRUD with EF Core (Code-First & SQL Server)
📂 Repository Pattern for abstraction and clean code
🔐 JWT Authentication + Role-Based Authorization using ASP.NET Identity
🌱 Data Seeding for predefined roles: Reader & Writer
📏 Validation via Data Annotations & FluentValidation
🔄 AutoMapper for mapping Domain Models to DTOs
📊 Powerful Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination
🧪 Tested with Swagger UI & Postman
🔌 Dependency Injection, Async Programming, and SOLID Principles
Whether you're learning backend development or looking for a well-architected .NET project — NZWalks is for you.
